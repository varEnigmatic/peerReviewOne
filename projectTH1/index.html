        <p>Currently I am the organizer of three local Meetup groups. The first one I thought of deals with object oriented programming. I have loved, "OOP," for as long as I can remember. When the Apple gave us Xcode I was extremely excited, but I couldn't make an app. I understood the syntax, but didn't know it took so much more. Still to this day my codes break, and I bang my head into the keyboard sm:)e!</p>
        <p>The second Meetup that I conduct revolves around a nonprofit organization, that is geared toward obtaining both hardware and software for disadvantaged youth. This battle has been up hill, as little to known either don't want to work for free or don't believe in what I'm trying to do. This is alright, I have plans and I don't intend to allow the noise of others to drown out my aspirations. I feel that all youth should have the same advantages no matter what their economic status may be. I hope that one day Remove The Wrench can make a <Strong>REAL</Strong> impact on society as a whole.</p>
